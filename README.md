# pSQL-Social

## Basically Go-Social-Media V2, but with Vue and Postgres

### Also the successor to Go-Vue-Chat

### Not finished, only just started. Hopefully the database query performance will be better, and the backend code improvements I made improve performance in general.

### I have included cascaded deletes in the schema but I have no idea if it works yet. I chose to not use an ORM because it just made things more confusing dealing with SQL the last time I used it with Go, and part of the point of this project is using SQL so I can get experience with it.

### I'm using fasthttp & fasthttp websocket since its faster and gorilla is no longer being maintained
