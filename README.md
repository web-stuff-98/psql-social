# pSQL-social (my portfolio project for Vue)

https://psql-social.herokuapp.com

This is my best filesharing/voip/video chat app. Go-Social-Media is similar except for it uses React and has a blog with nested comments. Also the WebRTC code for Go-Social-Media is crap and I can't be asked to fix it since it's an old project and debugging the socket events is annoying
