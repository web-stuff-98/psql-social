# pSQL-social (my portfolio project for Vue)

https://psql-social.herokuapp.com

This is my best filesharing/voip/video chat app. Go-Social-Media is similar except for it uses React and has a blog with nested comments. Also the WebRTC code for Go-Social-Media is crap and I can't be asked to fix it since it's an old project and debugging the socket events is annoying. The code for video chat in this project is a lot better, since you can change and toggle devices without it resetting the connection, and you can share your screen also.

Also I am mostly just learning PHP and Laravel now instead of adding stuff to this because I keep seeing Laravel as an essential job requirement for every single entry level job posting, aside from having a degree and commercial experience which I cannot get anyway
