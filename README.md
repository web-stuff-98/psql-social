# pSQL-social

## It's go-vue-chat but 99% rewritten. It also uses postgres and pinia, instead of MongoDB and vanilla vue state management. The performance and UI is better, but there is no desktop version. A desktop version could be made easily in a day.

## Features:

- Voip/Video chat
- Screen sharing
- Invitations
- Friend requests
- Filesharing
- Blocks/Bans
- Rate limiters
- Typescript types for socket events
- Validation for everything
