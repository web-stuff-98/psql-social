## Basically Go-Vue-Chat V2

### Not finished, only just started. It's going to be very similar to Go-Vue-Chat, but I am using postgres for the database, and I'm implementing Pinia for state management. Hopefully the database query performance will be better, and the backend code improvements I made improve performance in general. I'm completing the backend base functionality before I start on the client code.

### I have included cascaded deletes in the schema but I have no idea if it works yet. I chose to not use an ORM because it just made things more confusing dealing with SQL the last time I used it with Go.

### I'm using fasthttp & fasthttp websocket since its faster and gorilla toolkit is no longer being maintained
