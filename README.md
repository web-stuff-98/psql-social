# pSQL-social (my portfolio project for Vue)

https://psql-social.herokuapp.com

This is my best filesharing/voip/video chat app. Go-Social-Media is similar except for it uses React and has a blog with nested comments. Also the WebRTC code for Go-Social-Media is crap and I can't be asked to fix it since it's an old project and debugging the socket events is annoying.

This could be improved by parsing the socket message before sending it to the rest of VUe context, cant be bothered either, its fast enough, and there are other problems
